# Automated Application

Welcome to the **Automated Application** application! This tool is designed to automate the analysis of automotive track and climate chamber tests, 
Here you can see the main features and adapt for your necessity. There are available: dataprocessing files (.py); JS interation from FE (should be adapted for your FE); MainFlash to export application as .exe (.py); A basic CSS. The Engineering Calculations should supply by Engineer User. 

- **Automated Data Processing**: Convert raw test data into analysis-ready formats with just a few clicks.
- **Support for Multiple Data Formats**: Handles TDMS, DAT, and BIN file formats, converting them to CSV, Excel, or dataframes.
- **Engineering Calculations**: Perform complex calculations directly in Python, ensuring accuracy and speed.
- **Modular Interface**: Easy-to-use graphical interface developed with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- **Fast Execution**: Batch processing reduces the time required for data conversion from minutes to seconds.
